# Asynkron Durable Functions

Asynkron Durable Functions brings the familiar Azure Durable Functions programming model to any .NET environment. You register orchestrators and activities with a runtime, back it with the storage provider that fits your deployment, and the framework coordinates reliable, resumable workflows for you.

The runtime focuses on three goals:

- **Productive orchestration model** – deterministic orchestrators that call activities, wait on events, schedule timers, and compose sub-orchestrations using plain C#.
- **Portable hosting** – run inside minimal console apps, ASP.NET Core services, containers, or anywhere a .NET runtime is available.
- **Operational confidence** – multi-host safety, management APIs, and first-class telemetry make the workflows observable and easy to run in production.

Use the rest of the Durable Functions documentation set to learn how to build, host, and operate orchestrations with confidence.
