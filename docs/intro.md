# Welcome to the Asynkron docs

Asynkron builds actor-based tooling for resilient, cloud-native .NET applications. This documentation site collects the guides,
reference material, and operational advice for the different projects in the ecosystem.

## Projects you will find here

- **Proto.Actor** – the lightweight virtual actor framework at the heart of the platform.
- **Proto.Cluster** – distributed clustering, messaging, and service discovery built on top of Proto.Actor.
- **Proto.Persistence** – persistence providers and patterns for durable actors.
- **Ecosystem tooling** – diagnostics, templates, and integrations maintained by the Asynkron team.

## Navigating the documentation

Use the sidebar to drill into topic-specific guides. Each section blends conceptual explanations with runnable samples so you can
apply the patterns in your services quickly.
