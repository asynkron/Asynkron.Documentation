# Asynkron product documentation

This site collects documentation for the products built and maintained by Asynkron. Each product has its own space with guides, reference material, and runnable examples.

## Meet Asynkron

Asynkron is a team of distributed-systems veterans who have spent the last decade taming high-scale, mission-critical platforms across finance, industrial automation, and real-time communications. Today we channel that experience into the next wave of software acceleration—building AI tooling and AI-driven code generation that helps teams deliver distributed applications faster, safer, and with less guesswork. Whether you are a developer shipping your next microservice or an engineering leader modernizing a product line, we bring hard-earned architectural insight together with pragmatic AI to give you an unfair advantage.
