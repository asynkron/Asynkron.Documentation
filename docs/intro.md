# Asynkron product documentation

This site collects documentation for the products built and maintained by Asynkron. Each product has its own space with guides, reference material, and runnable examples.

## Meet Asynkron

Asynkron is a team of distributed-systems veterans who have spent the last decade taming high-scale, mission-critical platforms across finance, industrial automation, and real-time communications. Today we channel that experience into the next wave of software acceleration—building AI tooling and AI-driven code generation that helps teams deliver distributed applications faster, safer, and with less guesswork. Whether you are a developer shipping your next microservice or an engineering leader modernizing a product line, we bring hard-earned architectural insight together with pragmatic AI to give you an unfair advantage.

## Proto.Actor - The actor framework for .NET and Go

[Proto.Actor](./ProtoActor/overview.md) is our flagship actor framework for .NET and Go. It gives you a lightweight, cloud-native runtime for building resilient, distributed systems with message-driven actors, virtual actors, and cluster support. Explore the quick start, core concepts, and advanced modules like persistence, clustering, and testing utilities.

## Durable Functions - Reliable workflows for .NET

[Asynkron Durable Functions](./DurableFunctions/overview.md) lets you build long-running, reliable workflows in any .NET application using the durable orchestrator model. Start with the quick start, then dive into hosting guidance, orchestration patterns, and the operations handbook to ship resilient automation in production.

## LiveView - AI Companion MCP

[Asynkron LiveView](./LiveView/index.md) brings real-time, reactive UI updates to your applications with a lightweight server-driven model inspired by LiveView frameworks. Learn how to set up the runtime, compose interactive components, and deploy to production.

## TraceLens - OTEL UI and Collector

[TraceLens](./TraceLens/overview.md) provides observability tooling tailored for distributed actor systems. Use the guides to ingest telemetry, visualize actor flows, and troubleshoot live systems with minimal overhead.

## OtelMcp - AI-aware telemetry platform

[Asynkron.OtelMcp](./OtelMcp/index.md) fuses an OpenTelemetry collector, search engine, and MCP interface so AI systems can interpret signals in real time. Spin it up to let copilots query telemetry, trigger automations, and surface insights across your distributed services.

## OcppServer - Massive scale EV charging

[Asynkron.OcppServer](./OcppServer/index.md) delivers an OCPP 1.6 Central System tuned for fleets with hundreds of thousands of concurrent chargers. Learn how to onboard devices, keep firmware current, and integrate billing and energy-market workflows.

## Jsome - DTO generation and validation

[Asynkron.Jsome](./Jsome/index.md) is a .NET global tool that generates strongly typed clients and schema artefacts from Swagger/OpenAPI or JSON Schema sources. Follow the docs to install the CLI, configure templates, and automate DTOs, validators, Protocol Buffers, and more as part of your build pipeline.

More product families will be added over time. Check back regularly for new guides and updates.
