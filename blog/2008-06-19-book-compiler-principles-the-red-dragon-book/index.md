Parsing and languages have always been one of my main interests when it comes to programming.  
So a few weeks ago I decided to buy the “red dragon book” from Amazon.com.  
[http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Alfred-Aho/dp/0201100886](http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Alfred-Aho/dp/0201100886)  
(note: For some reason I managed to buy the edition from 1986 instead of 2006)

It is definetly one of the most interesting books I’ve ever read.  
Maybe the most interesting part is that It is very humbeling to see how bloody brilliant those old computer science language guys are.

My biggest problem at the moment is that I fall asleep every 3-4 pages.  
It is not because of boredom or anything, it’s just that I have to pause and reflect on what I have read for each page and that’s when I fall asleep 🙂

So if you are into geeky stuff like domain specific languages and such, read the book, it’s awesome!
