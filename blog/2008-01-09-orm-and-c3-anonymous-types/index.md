This entry explored using C# anonymous types as lightweight DTOs when streaming results from stored procedures. The original post included a few short snippets that demonstrated building a prototype object, executing a stored proc, and then projecting the results. To keep this static archive simpler, please consult the [source article](http://rogeralsing.com/2008/01/09/orm-and-c3-anonymous-types/) for the full code example.
