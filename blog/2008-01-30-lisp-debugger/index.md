Iâ€™m still working on my Lisp language clone.  
Today I started to add debugging support to it.  
I made the AST aware of the original source code, so each node can reference back to the place it was parsed from, and I also added a bit of call stack features.

<!-- truncate -->

Iâ€™m pretty satisfied with it so far, it almost feels like a real language now ðŸ˜‰

Anyway, here is a screenshot of the not so well designed GUI.
