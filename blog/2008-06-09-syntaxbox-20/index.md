Due to public request I am now kicking some life into my old **SyntaxBox** component again.  
The code base have been upgraded to C#3 and compiles for .NET 2.0 (using VS.NET2008)

<!-- truncate -->

The title here is a bit misleading, it is not a new major version yet.  
It is a cleaned up and upgrade of the old source.
