Iâ€™m still playing around with the outcome my [Linq Workspace Experiment](http://rogeralsing.com/2008/07/03/ddd-nworkspace-experiment/).

<!-- truncate -->

And I have to say that Iâ€™m fairly pleased with the result, itâ€™s only a handful of code (less than 100 LoC) but it makes testing so much easier.

Iâ€™m so pleased with it that we will be using this in a fairly large live project, a large portion of every Swedish citizens that turn 18 will pass through this system ðŸ™‚

It has enabled us to test all of our service methods with in mem data w/o ever changing,faking or mocking our repositories.

So cheers to both Erik Meijer for making Linq such a cool tool and to Jimmy Nilsson for inventing the workspace pattern ðŸ™‚
