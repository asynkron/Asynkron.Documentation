A few days ago I announced that I was working on a generic DSL parser : [http://rogeralsing.com/2010/03/23/generic-dsl-grammar-and-parser/](http://rogeralsing.com/2010/03/23/generic-dsl-grammar-and-parser/)  
Iâ€™m now porting the code to F# since it is more suited for AST traversal.

<!-- truncate -->

So it will take a few days more before I publish any code, I want to see what I can accomplish with F# first.
