An early alpha of our new service is available here:  
[http://crawlr.wombit.se](http://crawlr.wombit.se)

<!-- truncate -->

This service enables javescript driven applications, e.g. AngularJS, Knockout, Backbone sites to be indexed correctly by google using the \_escaped_fragment\_ approach.

We would be very thankful if anyone could provide examples how to integrate this in other environments also. Itâ€™s just an http get/post to our service to make it work.
