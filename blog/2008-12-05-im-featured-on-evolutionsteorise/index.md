The Swedish site EvolutionsTeori.se (Theory of evolution) has featured one of my blog posts regarding genetic programming.  
My code sample is used as a proof that evolution can infact occur inside a computer as a response to the opposite claims in the movie “Expelled”.

I guess I have to be a bit agnostic here;

So what does my code prove ?  
That evolution works w/o the need for a designer?  
Or that evolution works if it is set free inside a designed environment with designed rules ?

Your call 😉
