Iâ€™ve finally seen my own Linq support Live ðŸ˜›  
Untill now Iâ€™ve only been emitting NPath quereis and verified that NPath is correct.

<!-- truncate -->

The reason I havent tested it live untill now is that I only have my gaming machine to develop on atm. the dev machine is dead.

Anyway, Iâ€™m trying it against NWind MS Access DB right now and it works like a charm.  
I can even run fairly complex queries, even if it takes a bit of time on MS Access.

```
var res = from cust in ctx.Repository<Customer>() 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  where 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  cust.Orders.Any( 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  order => order.OrderDetails.Sum( 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  detail => detail.UnitPrice * detail.Quantity 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ) > 1000) 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  orderby cust.CompanyName 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  select cust;
```

This lists all customers that have atleast one order with the order total of 1000\$.  
I was a bit nervous before and thought that maybe it will fail.. even though the NPath looks correct and the NPath to SQL generator have been working fine for the last 3 years ðŸ˜‰
