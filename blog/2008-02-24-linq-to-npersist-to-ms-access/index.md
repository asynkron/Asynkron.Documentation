Iâ€™ve finally seen my own Linq support live ðŸ˜›
Until now Iâ€™ve only been emitting NPath queries and verified that NPath is correct.

<!-- truncate -->

The reason I havenâ€™t tested it live until now is that I only have my gaming machine to develop on at the moment. The dev machine is dead.

Anyway, Iâ€™m trying it against NWind MS Access DB right now and it works like a charm.  
I can even run fairly complex queries, even if it takes a bit of time on MS Access.

```csharp
var res = from cust in ctx.Repository<Customer>()
Â  Â  Â  Â Â  where
Â  Â  Â  Â Â  cust.Orders.Any(
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  order => order.OrderDetails.Sum( 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  detail => detail.UnitPrice * detail.Quantity 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ) > 1000) 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  orderby cust.CompanyName 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  select cust;
```

This lists all customers that have at least one order with the order total of 1000\$.
I was a bit nervous before and thought that maybe it will fail.. even though the NPath looks correct and the NPath to SQL generator have been working fine for the last 3 years ðŸ˜‰
