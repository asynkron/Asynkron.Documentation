MyLisp is now named DSLisp – Domain Specific (Language) Lisp.

<!-- truncate -->

I have published it as a project on CodePlex:  
[http://www.codeplex.com/DSLisp](http://www.codeplex.com/DSLisp)

The new name imples the purpose of the project.  
To act as a host for DSL’s.

The idea is to compile your DSL into the DSLisp AST.  
And then run your DSL inside the DSLisp engine.  
By doing this you can very easily add single step debugging and breakpoint support to your DSL. 

See the codeplex site for more info.
