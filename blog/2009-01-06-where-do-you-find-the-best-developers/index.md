I’ve always been fascinated with the different schools of software development.  
Some make games, some make 3D tools, some make web portal development and some do software for fighter jets etc.

<!-- truncate -->

So, in what branch of software development do you think we find the absolutely brightest developers?

I think the bloggosphere might contribute to some sort of blindness in this area, we only notice those who make the most noise, usually the consultant / trainer type of guys.  
At the top of this hierarchy are the “senior software architect” guys, they blog about domain models using O/R mappers and how to create nice web pages using MVC pattern and that type of things.

Ooh, so you want an WCF service in the middle? and Hibernate at the bottom?  
And maybe some domain specific language for configuring your favorite dependency injection framework?

Spice that up with some talks about unit tests and friction less development and you will be king of the hill in this sphere.

No offence to any of those guys, but how hard is that stuff really?  
Just to be clear; I have no delusions of knowing everything or being better than anyone in this area, there are of course really tough problems here too.

But what about those developers that write software for fighter jets?  
Or write games like World of Warcraft where you have to deal with thousands and thousands of concurrent users interacting at a very high transaction rate.  
Or maybe those who write 3D tools that are able to reduce the polygon count in a highres 3D mesh.

That is some seriously hardcore stuff.  
I feel like some soon to go extinct cave man when I think about how those things work.

So what branch of software development holds the best and the brightest?
