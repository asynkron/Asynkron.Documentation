I have blogged about this for quite a while now.  
Now Iâ€™ve finally cleaned up the code and published it at github:[https://github.com/rogeralsing/Precio.Infrastructure](https://github.com/rogeralsing/Precio.Infrastructure)

<!-- truncate -->

This is a small framework for UoW/Workspace support in .NET with Linq support.

The framework contains a Unit of Work implementation and providers for Entity Framework 4, NHibernate and MongoDB(using NoRM).  
There is also a small incomplete Blog sample project included.
