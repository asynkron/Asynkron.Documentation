I have added the Caramel code generator to my public repository at google code.  
[http://code.google.com/p/alsing/](http://code.google.com/p/alsing/)

<!-- truncate -->

Please note that this is very very alpha and not actually useful yet.

Before it can be used I need to finish the template support and fully implement the DB meta data importer.

But if you are interested in this kind of stuff and want to help out building it, please let me know.
