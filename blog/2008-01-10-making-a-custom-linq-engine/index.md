This article walked through building a toy LINQ provider by implementing `Where`/`Select` extension methods and plugging them into a custom namespace. It also included a downloadable sample project with the full code. The MDX build cannot render the inline generics from the original walkthrough, so only this summary is preserved here. Please read the [source post](http://rogeralsing.com/2008/01/10/making-a-custom-linq-engine/) for the full explanation and downloadable code.
