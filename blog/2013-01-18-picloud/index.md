Back in 2009 I blogged about F# in the cloud, an idea where you could pass an F# AST to a cloud and run it in parallell there :[ http://rogeralsing.com/2009/12/29/massive-parallelism-f-in-the-cloud/](http://rogeralsing.com/2009/12/29/massive-parallelism-f-in-the-cloud/)

It now seems like some guys have done just that using python : [http://www.picloud.com/](http://www.picloud.com/)
