This post originally walked through an experiment in expressing typed factory methods with C# 3.0 expression trees. The source article contains multiple code listings that dynamically construct delegates and compile expression trees. Rendering all of that code in this archive caused build issues, so the narrative here has been replaced by a pointer to the canonical version. Please refer to the [original entry](http://rogeralsing.com/2008/02/21/typed-factories-in-c3-managed-new/) for the complete walkthrough and samples.
